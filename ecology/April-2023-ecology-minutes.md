## Previous meeting notes

- No questions/updates from previous meeting

## Revamped R Lesson
### Background
- Official R repo was unmaintained, need to onboard new maintainer team
- Coincide with infrastructure transition. Michael's revamped lesson is already based on new infrastructure
- Want to explore best way for transition. Should be clear about the transition plan to avoid confusion
### Three major changes:
- Moving to full tidyverse-based lesson 
  - SC has more lessons more focused on base R
  - Make it clear goal of this lesson is not to make learners fluent in R, but provide data analytical solution
- Teaching ggplot before exploring and manipulating data
  - This allows learners to start making plots right away, immediate rewards
  - Establish data visualization as a key skill
- Restructured narrative arc guide learning objectives
  - From top-down structured lesson to a bottom-up narrative that is driven by newly introduced concepts
### Questions and comments
- "Intermediate R lesson" stadnalone or an addon to this lesson?
  - Can be a standalone (assumes this lesson as prereq) or as an addon
- Should we shift DC for ecology python version to match new structure? 
  - Python plotting is less self-contained and may require slightly different structures
  - CAC can make recommendations for reviewing Python lessons and potential restructuring
- Should we update Ecology section in https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/ to include lesson in devlopment to bring more visibility to this lesson
- Michael doesn't have time to maintain this lesson. Need a future plan:
  - Keep both versions side-by-side
  - Accept as-is
  - Put in lesson incubator

## Hold till next meeting:
Review https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/issues/259#issuecomment-1447938362 before next meeting
